21 years in, the landscape around open source evolved a lot. Today, "open
source" is not enough. In my opinion it is necessary, but it is not
sufficient. In this 3-part series I'll detail why, starting with Part 1
-- **why open source is necessary today**.

## What open source is

Free software started in the 80â€™s by defining a number of freedoms. The
author of free software has to grant users (and future contributors to
the software) those freedoms. To summarize, those freedoms made you free
to study, improve the software, and distribute your improvements to the
public, so that ultimately everyone benefits. That was done in reaction
to the apparition of "proprietary" software in a world that previously
considered software a public good.

When open source was defined in 1998, it focused on a more specific angle:
the rights users of the software get with the software, like access to the
source code, or lack of constraints on usage. This straight focus on user
rights (and less confusing naming) made it much more understandable to
businesses and was key to the success of open source in our industry today.

Despite being more business-friendly, open source was never a "business
model". Open source, like free software before it, is just a set of
freedoms and rights attached to software. Those are conveyed through software
licenses and using copyright law as their enforcement mechanism. Publishing
software under a F/OSS license may be a component of a business model, but
if is the only one, then you have a problem.

## Freedoms

The freedoms and rights attached to free and open source software bring
a number of key benefits for users.

The first, and most-often cited of those benefits is **cost**. Access
to the source code is basically free as in beer. Thanks to the English
language, this created interesting confusion in the mass-market as to
what the "free" in "free software" actually meant. You can totally sell
"free software" -- this is generally done by adding freedoms or bundling
services beyond what F/OSS itself mandates (and not by *removing* freedoms,
as some recently would like you to think).

If the cost benefit has proven more significant as open source evolved,
it's not because users are less and less willing to pay for software or
computing. It's due to the more and more ubiquitous nature of computing. As
[software eats the world](https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/),
the traditional software pay-per-seat models are getting less and less
adapted to how users work, and they create extra friction in a world
where everyone competes on speed.

As an engineer, I think that today, cost is a scapegoat benefit. What
matters more to users is actually **availability**. With open source
software, there is no barrier to trying out the software with all of its
functionality. You don't have to ask anyone for permission (or enter any
contractual relationship) to evaluate the software for future use, to
experiment with it, or just to have fun with it. And once you are ready
to jump in, there is no friction in transitioning from experimentation
to production.

As an executive, I consider **sustainability** to be an even more
significant benefit. When an organization makes the choice of deploying
software, it does not want to left without maintenance, just because
the vendor decides to drop support for the software you run, or just
because the vendor goes bankrupt. The source code being available for
anyone to modify means you are not relying on a single vendor for
long-term maintenance.

Having a multi-vendor space is also a great way to avoid lock-in. When
your business grows a dependency on software, the cost of switching to
another solution can get very high. You find yourself on the vulnerable
side of maintenance deals. Being able to rely on a market of vendors
providing maintenance and services is a much more sustainable way of
consuming software.

Another key benefit of open source adoption in a corporate setting is
that open source makes it easier to **identify and attract talent**.
Enterprises can easily identify potential recruits based on the open
record of their contributions to the technology they are interested in.
Conversely, candidates can easily identify with the open source
technologies an organization is using. They can join a company with
certainty that they will be able to capitalize on the software experience
they will grow there.

A critical benefit on the technical side is **transparency**. Access to
the source code means that users are able to look under the hood and
understand *by themselves* how the software works, or why it behaves
the way it does. Transparency also allows you to efficiently audit
the software for security vulnerabilities. Beyond that, the ability to
take and modify the source code means you have the possibility of
**self-service**: finding and fixing issues by yourself, without even
depending on a vendor. In both cases that increases your speed in
reacting to unexpected behavior or failures.

Last but not least: with open source you have the possibility to engage
in the community developing the software, and to influence its direction
by contributing directly to it. This is not about "giving back" (although
that is nice). Organizations that engage in the open source communities
are more efficient, anticipate changes, or can voice concerns about
decisions that would adversely affect them. They can make sure the
software **adapts to future needs** by growing the features they will
need tomorrow.

## Larger benefits for ecosystems

Beyond those user benefits (directly derived from the freedoms and rights
attached to F/OSS), open source software also has positive effects to
wider ecosystems.

Monopolies are bad for users. Monocultures are vulnerable environments.
Open source software allows challengers to group efforts and collaborate
to build an alternative to the monopoly player. It does not need to beat
or eliminate the proprietary solution -- being successful is enough to
create a balance and result in a healthier ecosystem.

Looking at the big picture, we live on a planet with limited natural goods,
where reducing waste and optimizing productivity is becoming truly
critical. As software gets pervasive and more and more people produce it,
the open source production model reduces duplication of effort and the waste
of energy of having the same solutions developed in multiple parallel
proprietary silos.

Finally, I personally think a big part of today's social issues is the
result of artificially separating our society between producers and
consumers. Too many people are losing the skills necessary to build
things, and are just given subscriptions, black boxes and content to
absorb in a well-oiled consumption machine. Free and open source software
blurs the line between producers and consumers by removing barriers and
making every consumer a potential producer. It is part of the solution
rather than being part of the problem.


All those benefits explain why open source software is so successful today.
Those unique benefits ultimately make a superior product, one that is a smart
choice for users. It is also a balancing force that drives good hygiene to
wider ecosystems, which is why I would go so far as saying it is necessary
in today's world. In [part 2](https://ttx.re/open-source-2019-part2.html)
we'll see why today, while being necessary, open source is no longer
sufficient.

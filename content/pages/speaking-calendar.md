Summary: Speaking calendar


### FOSDEM (February 1-2, Brussels)

I'll be delivering a talk on
[why open infrastructure matters](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/open_infrastructure/)
in the Janson auditorium as part of the Freedom main track! I'll also be
speaking in the Containers devroom about
[demystifying container runtimes](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/containers_k8s_runtimes/). As usual at FOSDEM, no registration necessary.

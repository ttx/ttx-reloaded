Next week, OpenStack contributors will come together in Denver, Colorado at
the [Project Teams Gathering](https://www.openstack.org/ptg)
to discuss in-person the work coming up for the
[Stein release cycle](https://releases.openstack.org/stein/schedule.html).
This regular face-to-face meeting time is critical:
it allows us to address issues that are not easily fixed in virtual
communications, like brainstorming solutions, agreeing on implementation
details, or building up personal relationships. Since day 0 in OpenStack
we have had such events, but their shape and form evolved with our community.

### A brief history of contributor events

It started with the Austin Design Summit in July 2010, where the basics of
the project were discussed. The second Design Summit in San Antonio at the
end of 2010 introduced a parallel business track, which grew in importance
as more organizations and potential users joined the fray. The contributors
gathering slowly became a subevent happening at the same time as the main
"Summit". By 2015, summits were 5-days events attracting 6000 people. It made
for a very busy week, and very difficult for contributors to focus on the
necessary discussions with the distractions and commitments of the main event
going on at the same time.

Time was ripe for a change, and that is when we introduced the idea of a
Project Teams Gathering (PTG). The PTG was a separate 5-day event for
contributors to discuss in-person in a calmer, more productive setting.
By the Austin Summit in 2016, it was pretty clear that was the only option
to get productive gatherings again, and the decision was made to roll out
our first PTG in February, 2017 in Atlanta. Attendees loved the small event
feel and their restored productivity. Some said they got more done during
that week than in all old Design Summits (combined), despite some challenges
in navigating the event. We iterated on that formula in Denver and Dublin,
creating tools to make the unstructured and dynamic event agenda more
navigable, by making what is currently happening more discoverable. The
format was extended to include other forms of contributor teams, like SIGs,
workgroups, or Ops meetups. Feedback on the event by the attendees was
extremely good.

### The limits of the PTG model

While the feedback at the event was excellent, over the last year it became
pretty clear that holding a separate PTG created a lot of tension. The most
obvious tension was between PTG and Summit. The PTG was designed as an
additional event, not a replacement. In particular, developers were still very
much wanted at the main *Summit* event, to maintain the technical level of the
event, to reach out to new contributors and users, to discuss with operators
the future of the project at the *Forum*. But it is hard to justify traveling
internationally 4 times per year to follow a mature project, so a lot of
people ended up choosing one or the other. Smaller teams usually skipped
the PTG, while a lot in larger teams would skip the Summit. That created
community fragmentation between the ones who could attend 4 events per year
and the ones who could not. And *those who could not* were on the rise: with
the growth in OpenStack adoption in China, the number of contributors, team
leaders and teams where most members are based in China increased
significantly.

Beyond that, the base of contributors to OpenStack is changing: less and less
vendor-driven and more and more user-driven. That is a generally good thing,
but it means that we are slowly moving away from contributors who are 100%
employed to work upstream (and therefore travel as many times a year as
necessary to maximize that productivity) toward contributors that spend a
couple of hours per week to help upstream (for which travel is at a premium).
There are a lot of things OpenStack needs to change to be more friendly to
this type of contributor, and the PTG format was not really helping in this
transition.

Finally, over the last year it became clear that the days of the 5-day-long
5000-people events were gone. Once the initial curiosity and hype-driven
attendance is passed, and people actually start to understand what OpenStack
can be used for (or not used for), you end up with a less overwhelming event,
with a more reasonable number of attendees and days. Most of the 2015-2016
reasons for a separate event are actually no longer applying.

### Trying a different trade-off

We ran a number of surveys to evaluate our options -- across Foundation
sponsors, across PTG attendees, across contributors at large. About 60%
of contributors supported co-locating the PTG with the Summit. Even only
considering past PTG attendees, 53% still support co-location. 85% of the
22 top contributing organizations also supported co-location, although some
of the largest ones would prefer to keep it separate. Overall, it felt like
enough of the environment changed that even for those who had benefited
from the event in the past, the solution we had was no longer necessarily
the optimal choice.

In Dublin, then in Vancouver, options were discussed with the Board, the
Technical Committee and the User Committee, and the
[decision was made](http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/foundation/2018-June/002598.html)
to relocate the Project Teams Gathering with the Summits in 2019.
The current plan is to run the first Summit in 2019 from Monday to Wednesday,
then a 3-day PTG from Thursday to Saturday. The Forum would still happen during
the Summit days, so the more strategic discussions that happened at the PTG
could move there.

Obviously, some of the gains of holding the PTG as a separate event will be
lost. In particular, a separate event allowed to have strategic discussions
(the Forum at the Summit) at a separate time in the development cycle as the
more tactical discussions (the PTG). Some of the frustration of discussing
both in the same week, when it's a bit late to influence the cycle focus,
will be restored. The Summit will happen close to releases again, without
giving that much time to vendors to build products on it, or deployers to
try it, reducing the quality of the feedback we get at the Forum.

That said, the co-location will strive to keep as much as we can of what
made the PTG unique and productive. In order to preserve the distinct
productive feel of the event, the PTG will be organized as a **completely
separate event**, with its own registration and branding. It will keep its
unstructured content and dynamic schedule tools. In order to prevent the
activities of the Summit from distracting PTG attendees with outside
commitments, the co-located PTG will happen on entirely separate days,
once the Summit is over. There are only so many days in a week though,
so the trade-off here is to end the PTG on the Saturday.

This change is likely to anger or please you depending on where you stand.
It is important to realize that there is no perfect solution here. Any
solution we choose will be a trade-off between a large number of variables:
including more contributors, maximizing attendee productivity, getting a
critical mass of people present to our events, contain travel cost...
We just hope that this new trade-off will strike a better balance for
OpenStack in 2019, and the Foundation will continue adapt its event strategy
to changing conditions in the future.
